const project = {
  name: 'Event Managment System using Blazor Server (UI)',
  details: 'I have already developed the server-side WebAPI using ASP.NET Core. Thus, I will be developing the client-side using an interactive web UI framework called Blazor Server with C#. Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.',
  motivation: 'Having learnt C#, EF Core and ASP.NET Core, having built a backend service with the technologies. I guess the next thing is to build an interactive web UI for the backend services. Blazor Server is the framework of choice',
